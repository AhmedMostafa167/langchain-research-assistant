# LangChain Research Assistant

LangChain Research Assistant is a tool designed to streamline research workflows by generating summaries, structured reports, and insightful analyses using AI. It integrates LangChain's `Runnable` interfaces and Hugging Face's `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` model to process academic queries effectively.

## Project Overview

1. **Model Architecture**  
   The assistant is built using LangChain and Hugging Face. It incorporates a pipeline of components that handle:
   - Query generation for retrieving relevant documents from ArXiv.
   - Summarization and structured reporting based on retrieved information.
   - Prompt engineering with custom templates for concise and informative outputs.

2. **Deployment**  
   The application is deployed using **FastAPI** combined with **LangServe**, providing a user-friendly API and a UI for seamless interaction. The `FastAPI` server exposes an endpoint where users can submit queries and receive detailed, structured responses.

3. **Monitoring**  
   LangSmith is utilized to monitor and log the performance of the LangChain pipelines. It provides insights into chain execution, ensuring transparency and enabling debugging for continuous improvement.
